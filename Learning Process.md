## Question 1: What is the Feynman Technique?
Feynman Technique is a method for learning by explaining a concept in simple terms, as if teaching it to a 12-year-old, to identify and fill the gaps in understanding.

## Question 2: Most Interesting Story or Idea from Barbara Oakley’s TED Talk
The most interesting idea is Barbara Oakley’s concept of the “learning how to learn” framework, particularly her personal story of struggling with math as a child and later mastering it by leveraging active and diffused modes of thinking, showing that anyone can learn complex subjects with the right approach.

## Question 3: What are Active and Diffused Modes of Thinking?
- **Active Mode**: Focused, deliberate thinking where we concentrate on a task, such as solving a problem or studying a concept, engaging our brain’s full attention.
- **Diffused Mode**: Relaxed, subconscious thinking that occurs during activities like walking or resting, allowing your brain to make connections and process information in the background.

## Question 4: Steps to Take When Approaching a New Topic (from Josh Kaufman’s Video)
- Deconstruct the skill into smaller sub-skills.
- Learn just enough to practice and self-correct.
- Remove barriers to practice, such as distractions.
- Commit to practising for at least 20 hours.

## Question 5  
**What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?**

- Use the Feynman Technique to explain concepts in simple words.
- Practice focused sessions using the "Deep Work" principle.
- use pomodora technique.
- Keep phone on silent and notifications disabled during learning time.
- Block social media during work hours using tools.
- Switch between active and diffused modes by combining focused work with breaks.
- Break large topics into smaller concepts and learn them incrementally.
- Set internal deadlines to stay accountable.
- Use self-created examples and code to reinforce understanding.
- Frequently review and revise by teaching others or writing notes.
